The \fBRAWDNAT\fR target will rewrite the destination address in the IP header,
much like the \fBNETMAP\fR target.
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-destination\fR \fIaddr\fR[\fB/\fR\fImask\fR]
Network address to map to. The resulting address will be constructed the
following way: All 'one' bits in the \fImask\fR are filled in from the new
\fIaddress\fR. All bits that are zero in the mask are filled in from the
original address.
.PP
See the \fBRAWSNAT\fR help entry for examples and constraints.
